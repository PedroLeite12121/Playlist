                The club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
                So the bar is where I go<br>
                Me and my friends at the table doing shots<br>
                Drinking fast and then we talk slow<br><br>
                
                Come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
                And trust me, I'll give it a chance<br>
                Now take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox<br>
                And then we start to dance<br>
                And now I'm singing like<br><br>
                
                Girl, you know I want your love<br>
                Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
                Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
                Say: Boy, let's not talk too much<br>
                Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
                Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                Come, come on now, follow my lead<br><br>
                
                I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
                We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
                Although my heart is falling too<br>
                I'm in love with your body<br>
                And last night you were in my room<br>
                And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
                Everyday discovering something brand new<br>
                I'm in love with your body<br><br>
                
                Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I<br>
                I'm in love with your body<br>
                Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I<br>
                I'm in love with your body<br>
                Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I<br>

                One week in, we let the story begin<br>
                We're going out on our first date<br>
                You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat<br>
                Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate<br><br>
                
                We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>
                And how your family is doing okay<br>
                Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat<br>
                Tell the driver: Make the radio play<br>
                And I'm singing like<br><br>
                
                Girl, you know I want your love<br>
                Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
                Come on now, follow my lead<br>

                Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
                Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                Come, come on now, follow my lead<br><br>
                
                I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
                We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
