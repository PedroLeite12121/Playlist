            <p>One thing, I don't know why<br>
                It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
                Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme<br>
                To explain in due time (all I know)<br><br>

                Time is a valuable thing<br>
                Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings<br>
                Watch it count down to the end of the day<br>
                The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (it's so unreal)<br><br>

                You didn't look out below<br>
                Watch the time go right out the window<br>
                Trying to hold on, to didn't even know<br>
                I wasted it all just to watch you go (watch you go)<br><br>

                I kept everything inside<br>
                And even though I tried, it all fell apart<br>
                What it meant to me will eventually<br>
                Be a memory of a time when<br><br>

                I tried so hard and got so far<br>
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter<br>
                I had to fall to lose it all<br>
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter<br><br>

                One thing, I don't know why<br>
                It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
                Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme<br>
                To remind myself how I tried so hard (I tried so hard)<br><br>

                In spite of the way you were mocking me<br>
                Acting like I was part of your property<br>
                Remembering all the times you fought with me<br>
                I'm surprised it got so far (got so far)<br><br>

                Things aren't the way they were before<br>
                You wouldn't even recognize me anymore<br>
                Not that you knew me back then<br>
                But it all comes back to me (in the end)<br><br>

                You kept everything inside<br>
                And even though I tried, it all fell apart<br>
                What it meant to me will eventually<br>
                Be a memory of a time when<br><br>

                I tried so hard and got so far<br>
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter<br>
                I had to fall to lose it all<br>
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter<br><br>

                I've put my trust in you<br>
                Pushed as far as I can go<br>
                For all this<br>
                There's only one thing you should know<br><br>
