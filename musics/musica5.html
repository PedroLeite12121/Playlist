            <p>Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time<br>
                I feel alive<br>
                And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah!<br>
                I'm floating around in ecstasy<br>
                So don't stop me now<br>
                Don't stop me<br><br>

                'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time<br>
                I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky<br>
                Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity<br>
                I'm a racing car passing by, like Lady Godiva<br>
                I'm gonna go, go, go<br>
                There's no stopping me<br>
                I'm burning through the sky, yeah!<br>
                Two hundred degrees<br>
                That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit<br>
                I'm travelling at the speed of light<br>
                I wanna make a supersonic man out of you<br><br>

                Don't stop me now<br>
                I'm having such a good time<br>
                I'm having a ball<br>
                Don't stop me now<br>
                If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call<br>
                Don't stop me now ('cause I'm havin' a good time)<br>
                Don't stop me now (yes, I'm havin' a good time)<br>
                I don't wanna stop at all<br><br>

                I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars<br>
                On a collision course<br>
                I am a satellite, I'm out of control<br>
                I am a sex machine ready to reload<br>
                Like an atom bomb about to<br>
                Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode<br><br>

                I'm burning through the sky, yeah!<br>
                Two hundred degrees<br>
                That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit<br>
                I'm travelling at the speed of light<br>
                I wanna make a supersonic woman of you<br><br>

                Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me<br>
                Hey, hey, hey<br>
                Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
                I like it<br>
                Don't stop me, don't stop me<br>
                Have a good time, good time<br>
                Don't stop me, don't stop me<br><br>

                Ooh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah!<br>
