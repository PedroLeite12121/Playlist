            <p>Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind<br>
                Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind<br>
                Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm lying<br><br>

                But I'm only human after all<br>
                I'm only human after all<br>
                Don't put your blame on me<br>
                Don't put your blame on me<br><br>

                Take a look in the mirror and what do you see?<br>
                Do you see it clearer or are you deceived<br>
                In what you believe?<br><br>

                'Cause I'm only human after all<br>
                You're only human after all<br>
                Don't put the blame on me<br>
                Don't put your blame on me<br><br>

                (Oh-oh) some people out of luck<br>
                (Oh-oh) some people think I can solve them<br>
                (Oh-oh) Lord heavens above<br><br>

                I'm only human after all<br>
                I'm only human after all<br>
                Don't put the blame on me<br>
                Don't put the blame on me<br><br>

                Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie<br>
                Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry<br>
                Making you cry<br><br>

                'Cause I'm only human after all<br>
                I'm only human after all<br>

                I'm only human, I make mistakes<br>
                I'm only human, that's all it takes<br>
                To put the blame on me<br>
                Don't put the blame on me<br><br>

                (Ooh) 'cause I'm no prophet or Messiah<br>
                (Ooh) you should go looking somewhere higher<br><br>

                I'm only human after all<br>
                I'm only human after all<br>

                I'm only human, I do what I can<br>
                I'm just a man, I do what I can<br>
                Don't put the blame on me<br>
                Don't put your blame on me</p>
