                Will me, thrill me<br>
                You can never kill me<br><br>

                Tell me what has become of my life<br>
                I have a wife and two children who love me<br>
                I am the victim of police brutality, now<br><br>

                I'm tired of being the victim of hate<br>
                Your ripping me of my pride<br>
                Oh, for God's sake<br>
                I look to heaven to fulfill it's prophecy<br>

                Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?<br>
                Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now<br><br>

                I'm tired of being the victim of shame<br>
                They're throwing me in a class with a bad name<br>
                I can't believe this is the land from which I came<br><br>

                You know I really do hate to say it<br>
                The government don't wanna see<br>

                You can never trash me<br>
                Hit me, kick me<br>
                You can never get me<br><br>
